From an email on 2017/10/19 on the ovs-discuss list:

I don't know how it works with OVS+DPDK, but with the kernel datapath you need some L3 interfaces 
(one for each subnet/VLAN; IIRC you can use OVS internal interfaces here) and then you need to 
enable routing in the Linux kernel. That, or you need to use an OpenFlow controller 
and program all the routing functions (rewrite MAC address, decrement TTL, etc.) via flows.

Some example code in a larger project:
